## Adidas Order Checker
Checks the status of adidas online orders. At the moment this supports adidas UK, US, FR and DE. I can add support for other locales if I am provided with an order for that locale as an example.

## Instructions
- Git clone into the repository or download the zip file
- You need python 3+ to run and you need requests and bs4 installed (this can be done with `pip install requests` and `pip install bs4` respectively)
- You must then put the details of the orders you want to check in the orders.txt file in the format `ordernumber:email` DO NOT FORGET THE : (no spaces)
- Then run order-checker.py

## FAQ
**Will you help me?** Probably not but DM me if you can't get it to work after trying to google your issue first. EDIT: Nope, I will not.
